# VTTL v2.0 Implementation Tasks

## 🎯 Current Status: **Checkpoint 1 - COMPLETE ✅ → Moving to Checkpoint 2**

## Checkpoint 1: Core Foundation ✅
- [x] Create v2 folder structure
- [x] Write README.md documentation
- [x] Create TASKS.md checklist
- [x] Create default scene_state.json with table, lights, camera
- [x] Basic package.json for server
- [x] Python requirements.txt and virtual environment
- [x] Basic server main.js with JSON loading
- [x] Basic client index.html with PlayCanvas + GSAP

## Checkpoint 2: Server Core (JSON-First)
- [x] Basic Express server with WebSocket
- [x] JSONSceneLoader class - loads scene from JSON file
- [x] GameState class - holds current scene state in memory
- [ ] DiffCalculator class - compares states and finds changes
- [ ] SyncManager class - sends diffs to clients
- [x] Basic HTTP endpoints for health check
- [x] **Test**: Server starts and loads JSON successfully

## Checkpoint 3: Python Core API (SOLID)
- [ ] core/json_manager.py - SceneJSONManager class (<300 lines)
- [ ] core/sync_client.py - ServerSyncClient class (<200 lines)
- [ ] core/validation.py - JSONValidator class (<150 lines)
- [ ] entities/base_entity.py - BaseEntity abstract class (<100 lines)
- [ ] entities/geometry.py - GeometryEntity class (<200 lines)
- [ ] main_controller.py - SceneController facade (<200 lines)
- [ ] **Test**: Python can load, modify, and save JSON

## Checkpoint 4: Basic Client (PlayCanvas)
- [ ] Basic HTML page with PlayCanvas
- [ ] WebSocket client connection
- [ ] EntityManager for creating/updating 3D objects
- [ ] Initial scene loading from server
- [ ] **Test**: Client displays scene from JSON

## Checkpoint 5: Sync System
- [ ] Server detects JSON file changes
- [ ] Server calculates and sends diffs
- [ ] Client receives and applies diffs
- [ ] Animation detection (position, rotation, scale)
- [ ] Smooth animations for numeric properties
- [ ] **Test**: Python changes JSON → Client updates smoothly

## Checkpoint 6: Screenshot Integration
- [ ] utils/screenshot_manager.py - ScreenshotManager class (<150 lines)
- [ ] Server endpoint for triggering screenshots
- [ ] Automatic screenshot after each sync
- [ ] Screenshot storage in data/screenshots/
- [ ] **Test**: Every scene change generates screenshot

## Checkpoint 7: AI Integration (Ollama)
- [ ] ai/ollama_client.py - Enhanced OllamaClient (<300 lines)
- [ ] ai/scene_interpreter.py - SceneInterpreter (<400 lines)
- [ ] Natural language command parsing
- [ ] Command to scene operation mapping
- [ ] AI response generation with confirmation
- [ ] **Test**: "Place a red cube" → Scene updates → AI confirms

## Checkpoint 8: Advanced Features
- [ ] operations/animation_controller.py - AnimationController (<250 lines)
- [ ] operations/layout_manager.py - LayoutManager (<200 lines)
- [ ] Entity arrangement patterns (grid, circle, line)
- [ ] Complex animations and transitions
- [ ] **Test**: "Arrange cubes in a circle" works

## Checkpoint 9: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Unit tests for each Python class
- [ ] Integration tests for full workflow
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] **Test**: All features work reliably

## Checkpoint 10: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Docker deployment (optional)
- [ ] **Test**: New users can set up and use system

## 🏗️ Current Focus: **Checkpoint 1 Implementation**

### Next Immediate Tasks:
1. Create comprehensive scene_state.json with all needed elements
2. Set up basic server package.json and dependencies
3. Create Python virtual environment and requirements.txt
4. Verify basic folder structure is correct

### Success Criteria for Checkpoint 1:
- ✅ Folder structure exists and is organized
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and clear
- ⏳ Default scene JSON contains table, lights, camera
- ⏳ Basic dependency files exist
- ⏳ Project can be set up by following README

## 🎨 Architecture Notes

### SOLID Principles Implementation:
- **SRP**: Each class has one responsibility (JSON, validation, sync, etc.)
- **OCP**: BaseEntity allows extension without modification
- **LSP**: All entities can be used through BaseEntity interface
- **ISP**: Separate interfaces for different capabilities
- **DIP**: High-level classes depend on abstractions

### Performance Considerations:
- Diff-based updates minimize network traffic
- JSON validation prevents invalid states
- Efficient 3D rendering with PlayCanvas
- Local Ollama for fast AI responses

### Error Handling Strategy:
- Validation at JSON level prevents corruption
- Graceful degradation if AI unavailable
- Client resilience to network issues
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
